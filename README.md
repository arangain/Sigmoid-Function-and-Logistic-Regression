**Exploring Sigmoid Function and Logistic Regression**

Overview:
- This repository is dedicated to exploring the sigmoid function, a foundational element in logistic regression used widely in binary classification tasks.

Objectives:
- Demonstrate the properties and computation of the sigmoid function.
- Implement logistic regression to perform binary classification.
- Explore the effects of different thresholds on logistic regression predictions.

Features:
- Implementation of the sigmoid function using NumPy.
- Utilization of logistic regression for a simple binary classification task.
- Interactive visualization of logistic regression results using matplotlib.

Dataset:
- The example used in this project is synthetic and involves tumor classification based on hypothetical data:
x_train: Features (e.g., tumor size).
y_train: Binary labels (0 for benign, 1 for malignant).

Visualizations:
- Plot of the sigmoid function to demonstrate its characteristics.
- Interactive plot showing logistic regression applied to training data, with options to adjust model thresholds.
